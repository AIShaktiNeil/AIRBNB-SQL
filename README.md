# AIRBNB-SQL
# Airbnb Insights SQL Project

## Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb data using SQL to generate actionable insights about listing performance, pricing trends, and neighborhood characteristics. The SQL queries in this project clean, transform, and analyze the data, providing valuable metrics that can inform business decisions.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** Airbnb listings data, which includes information on listing types, prices, locations, availability, host details, and reviews.
- Fingertips.com/ SQL/projects

## Project Structure

- **Airbnb_insights.sql:**  
  Contains all SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **README.md:**  
  This document outlining the project details and how to run the SQL scripts.

## Key Features & Queries

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  - **Handled** missing or inconsistent data entries.
  - **Transformed** raw data into a structured format ready for analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Analysis:**  
  - **Analyzed** listing distribution by neighborhood and property type.
  - **Examined** pricing trends through aggregation functions and statistical summaries.
  
- **Advanced Insights:**  
  - **Joined** multiple tables to correlate host performance with listing quality.
  - **Utilized** window functions and subqueries to generate in-depth metrics (e.g., occupancy rates, review averages).

## How to Run the Project
